Refer(www.envirocar.org)

## Installation

Use the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.envirocar.app) to install the app on your device.

We are planning to include the project into F-Droid in the near future.

## Development

This software uses the gradle build system and is optimized to work within Android Studio 1.3+.
The setup of the source code should be straightforward. Just follow the Android Studio guidelines
for existing projects.

## OBD simulator

be used on another Android device and mock the actual car adapter.
